                        <strong>Targeted pulsar searches of SNRs, PWNe, and unidentified Fermi gamma-ray sources</strong>
                        <br>Supernova remnants (SNRs), pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and Fermi gamma-ray sources host, arguably, some of the most interesting radio pulsars. The discovery of a radio pulsar coincident with a SNR/PWN/gamma-ray source is crucial for understanding the energy budget of such systems and, vice-versa, multi-wavelength counterparts provide substantially more context for understanding the nature of the radio pulsar itself. Discovering young pulsars associated with SNRs or PWNe is important for understanding the Galactic neutron star formation rate, the nature of the supernova explosion, and the injection of high-energy particles into the interstellar medium. Unidentified Fermi gamma-ray sources provide a treasure map for deep pulsar searches and, for example: the millisecond pulsars (MSPs) found can probe accretion physics (e.g. "transitional" MSPs), provide new precision timers for the International Pulsar Timing Array, as well as identify exotic binaries capable of testing gravity and/or constraining the neutron star equation of state.</p><p>
                        <strong>Globular Cluster Searches</strong>
                        <br>Globular clusters (GCs) harbor a very large number of MSPs per unit stellar mass compared with the Galactic plane. This is because the dense stellar environments in the cores (10<sup>4</sup> − 10<sup>3</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> pc<sup>−3</sup>) promote collisions and exchange interactions that create binaries capable of recycling old neutron stars to become MSPs. A total of 146 pulsars have been discovered in globular clusters to date, the majority of them MSPs. Some clusters are spectacularly prolific: Terzan 5 and 47 Tuc host 34 and 25 pulsars respectively. Surveying them with MeerKAT therefore has the potential for rich and rapid reward.</p>

                        <strong>Extragalactic pulsar and transient searches</strong>
                        <br>MeerKAT has the sensitivity to reveal new pulsars and fast transients beyond the Milky Way. Studying extragalactic pulsars we can help us understand the relationship between the formation of neutron stars and their environement. Only 29 such extragalactic pulsars are known, and all are located in the Magellanic Clouds. Using MeerKAT we will reach a survey sensitivity beyond anything other survey performed before to study not only the Magellanic Clouds but also other galaxies of the local group and beyond. Detecting pulsars and fast transients outside the local group, and determining how much their signal was dispersed by the intergalactic medium will begin to provide us with the tools needed to probe the structure of the intergalact medium. Moreover, understanding the nearby population of giant pulse emitting, or radio-emitting magnetars, has gained even more importance given that they are proposed models for at least some of the fast radio bursts (FRBs) and this is further highlighted by the recent discovery of a repeating FRB.</p><p>
			<strong>Towards a Galactic census</strong>
                        <br>The known pulsar population has increased by nearly 50% sources, since 2010 when TRAPUM was first envisioned. 
This increase has been achieved by improving techniques and methods on existing telescopes, and new telescopes like LOFAR. 
Still, the task of finding even more pulsars could not be more timely.
With new pulsars, new science is enabled, resulting from the bulk properties of the discovered population, from discovered pulsars being probes of the surrounding medium, or by being
 exceptional laboratories for testing theories of gravity. With MeerKAT being many times more sensitive than Parkes, the previous largest dish used for pulsar searches in the South, the search for pulsars in the
 Galactic plane - the birth place of pulsars - provides a significant and rare sharp increase in sensitivity for exploring the dynamic radio sky. The hundreds of beams combined with much increased sensitivity mean a significant increase in search capability, making a large-scale survey with MeerKAT not only possible, but in fact mandatory.  With time provided by MPIfR’s “S-Band Project”, TRAPUM will conduct a L-Band survey along parts of the inner Galaxy. This TRAPUM survey will be the most sensitive survey of the inner Galactic plane ever conducted, being the benchmark and testbed for the later SKA surveys.</p><p>
			<strong>Using pulsars to probe gravity, dark matter &amp; stellar populations in the Galactic Centre</strong>
                        <br>The discovery of a pulsar closely orbiting the super-massive black hole at the centre of our Galaxy, Sgr A*, would not only supersede all previous tests of General Relativity (GR) in\
the strong-field regime, it would also enable the space-time around a rotating black hole to be probed with high precision and in a model independent fashion; for example, allowing tests of the cosmic censorship conjecture and the no hair theorem. Such a "laboratory" for precision tests of GR and black hole physics would be unrivalled by any future astrometric measurements of the S-Stars. Furthermore, mass-segregation 
in the central parsec may also lead to the presence of additional gravitational testbeds in the form of stellar-mass pulsar black hole binaries. As part of the MPIfR “S-Band Project”, the Max-Planck receivers will be used to conduct a sensitive survey of the innermost region of the Galaxy in the vicinity of the black hole. The MPIfR will share the results with TRAPUM as input for further studies.</p><p>
                        <strong>Fast transients – working with <a href='http://www.meertrap.org/'>MeerTRAP</a> to discovering and understand source populations</strong>
                        <br>The fast transient landscape has changed dramatically since 2010 with the discovery of the population of FRBs, including the revelation that some repeat,  which are exciting in themselves but also highlighted that the dynamic radio sky is still largely unexplored and with potentially more rich rewards. MeerKAT’s unique combination of wide FoV, high sensitivity, and wide bandwidth will provide supreme sensitivity per unit time and frequency making it a prime instrument to study the transient sky. We will carry out <em>commensal observing for fast transients on all of the TRAPUM observations</em> proposed here: High energy point sources and SNRs, globular clusters and external galaxies. </br>
			<br> Although not yet granted observing time we also consider here the exciting possibility of the detectability of Lorimer-burst brightness (30 Jy and >400-σ) FRBs with a <strong>MeerKAT Fly’s Eye experiment</strong> (i.e. single-dish observing). In Fly’s Eye mode, MeerKAT will instantaneously cover 0.8 × 64 = 51.2 deg<sup>2</sup>, and will therefore be able to detect rare, bright transient events. Finally, alongside the sheer increase in the number of FRBs detected the other major development is that FRB 121102 has exhibited repeated bursts seen both at Arecibo and with the GBT (Scholz et al. 2016). These bursts are characterised by a range of flux density and strongly varying spectral indices and a wide range of modulation indices that have so far prevented the detection of any possible underlying periodicity. The repeating nature indicates that they are not from a cataclysmic event and suggest that at least some FRBs are possibly associated with neutron star origins, like magnetars or giant pulses from radio pulsars. Crucial to understanding what this means for the FRB population as a whole is <em>determining if all FRBs repeat</em> or whether there are multiple classes.</p><p>
                        <strong>Follow Up Timing (To be proposed for) </strong>
                        <br>After the initial discovery of a pulsar, we want to extract as much science as possible by follow-up timing. Therefore, it is an absolutely crucial aspect of characterising the new TRAPUM pulsars to get a timing solution. In its most basic form this means getting an accurate position, period and period derivative so that one can compare the pulsar properties with the known pulsar population, and in particular for those sources that are found in our targeted searches we are interested in knowing their characteristic ages and their spin-down energies to compare with the SNRs and high energy emission, for example. We are also interested in determining whether or not the sources are potentially high precision timers and so useful for gravitational wave searches, and/or members of binary systems and so potentially useful for mass determinations or tests of gravity.</p>

                      <p>We have started our observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud with TRAPUM in 2021. We have nearly completed four out of eight pointings in this L-band survey, which uses 769 coherent beams and the core dishes of MeerKAT. The survey is partially targeted to supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae. We have discovered several new extragalactic pulsars in the SMC, which you can read about on the  <a href="./discoveries.html"> DISCOVERIES </a> webpage. We are also observing other nearby galaxies with the full array. </p>

			<h2>First Fermi Unidentified Sources Search Observations!</h2>
			<span class='date'>
                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> 20 June 2020</span>
                      <p>We have made our first observations of a set of Fermi Unidentified Sources with TRAPUM. We observed about a dozen sources using all the available telescopes and about 250 beams arranged to sample the entire gamma-ray error circle of the sources. This forms the first set of sources in our sample prepared for our initial shallow survey which is using the L-band receiver and will include a two-pass approach. News on <a href="./discoveries.html"> DISCOVERIES </a> soon. </p>
		      <h2>First Globular Cluster Observations!</h2>

		      <p>TRAPUM has made its first observations! Using all the available telescopes 288 beams were formed and used to observe the clusters Terzan 5, 47 Tucanae and NGC 6624 for about 4 hours each. Data analysis is ongoing. Stand by for announcements of discoveries which will appear on our <a href="./discoveries.html"> DISCOVERIES </a> webpage.</p>


		      <h2>Globular Cluster Pulsars Discovered</h2>
                        <span class='date'>
                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Update May 2020 </span>
		      <p>Working with the <a href="http://www.meertime.org/"> MeerTIME </a> team we have searched 10 Globular clusters using search mode data recorded using the PTUSE backends for a beam pointed at one of the known pulsars in the cluster. So far we have discovered 10 new pulsars and you can find a summary of the details of these pulsars at our <a href="./discoveries.html"> DISCOVERIES </a> webpage. The TRAPUM surveys will use between 250 and 400 beams to allow for covering the entire cluster and will be able to use all 64 dishes to give greater sensitivity.</p>

		      <h1>Project Organisation:</h1>
		      <p>The management of the TRAPUM project will
		      build upon experience gained from our membership
		      in other large international collaborations such
		      as LOFAR, the EPTA and SUPERB. An executive
		      committee composed of the two PIs (Stappers and
		      Kramer) and a further five members will be the
		      decision making body responsible for
		      organisation, membership, resolution, funding
		      and planning. These five additional members
		      correspond to approximately 10% of the total
		      membership and will be drawn from each of the
		      science working groups (see below), respecting
		      diversity in nationality and gender, and will
		      serve a limited term of no more than two
		      years. The PIs will have the casting vote if
		      required. While the science working groups will
		      have significant overlap in membership and
		      science topics they will have clear and distinct
		      goals. In addition there will be two technology
		      working groups which will work with and across
		      all the science groups to provide the hardware,
		      software and practical development necessary to
		      meet the scientific goals. It is expected that
		      the technology group members will have strong
		      overlap with all the scientific groups, with at
		      least one member from each present.</p>

		      <h2>The working groups are broken down into the following:</h2>
		      <ul>
			<li><strong>Galactic plane survey:</strong> Planning and executing the Galactic plane and Fermi excess survey. This is the largest single observing project and will require strong coordination of resources to ensure the most ecient observing. It will liase strongly with the targeted surveys group to ensure no overlap of targets.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted surveys:</strong> Planning and executing the surveys of the Galactic centre, globular clusters, exter- nal galaxies and high-energy sources. These surveys are grouped together as they all require similar approaches, but they will be broken down further into specific teams which may not include all members.</li>
<li><strong>Pulsar follow-up:</strong> Extracting maximum information from newly discovered pulsars eciently. Liaise with MeerKAT and worldwide pulsar timing projects for follow up radio timing. Organise observations at high energies, optical and perhaps non-photonic windows.</li>
<li><strong>Transient survey and follow-up:</strong> Detection of transient signals and triggering of multi-wavelength follow- up observations. Have agreements in place with a variety observatories to follow-up transients at short notice. Liase with ThunderKAT for follow up as well.</li>
<li><strong>Commensal observing survey:</strong> This task will involve liaising with
		      the different working groups to determine what
		      resources can be used and when and also to
		      optimise the observing strategies of the
		      targeted surveys described above to ensure optimal transient detection capabilities. Overlap with the follow up component of the Transients working group.</li>
<li><strong>Beamforming:</strong> Development of scheme for phasing up array and polarisation and flux calibration. Includes experts who have performed similar work with other arrays like WSRT,VLA and LOFAR. Majority of the work will be in the initial phases of roll out of beamforming, but then will have a continuing reduced role to assess problems if/when they arise with calibration and related issues.</li>
<li><strong>Processing:</strong> Particular focus on searching multiple data streams for periodic and transient signals. Also responsible for the organisation of data types, storage and transfer. Includes experts in machine learning approaches to transient and pulsar candidate identification.</li>
<li><strong>Outreach working group:</strong> This is an important aspect of the proposal which all members will contribute to. It will be led by people with significant experience in professional and public outreach and educators.</li>

                        <h1>Public Engagement</h1><p>Our public engagement programme focuses on the distinct areas: the public at large, and school children in particular. The school-focused thrust engages children in South Africa and other SKA-node-bearing countries as a first priority, but with a global component as well. The content of the various components listed below relates to the TRAPUM mission, which focuses on radio transients and pulsars. Below are the main components planned in our public engagement programme for TRAPUM:<ul>
                            <li>Produce a monthly newsletter to appear in a selection of South African print media, as well as online news portals. Existing contacts with independent science writers in South Africa to be followed up.</li>
                            <li>Perform hands-on, real observing and data analysis, engagements with schools building on the extensive experience of our team members but tailoring it to the specific needs.</li>
                            <li>Engage with the IAU’s OAD office and the SKA Communication and Outreach Team to see if mutually beneficial programmes can be launched as part of the TRAPUM public engagement programme.</li>
                            <li>Establish a TRAPUM citizen science component that will evolve from the Zooniverse project Pulsar Hunters and use it as a mean for public engagement but also to enable science in its own right.</li>
                            <li>Design, set up and maintain a well-structured webpage as well as both Twitter and Facebook profiles.</li>
                            <li>Develop simple pulsar-related materials that can be used in schools in a variety of modalities.</li>
                            <li>TRAPUM members will get involved in speaking at local schools during their visits to South Africa.</li>
                            <li>Involve current SKA bursary holders at universities to participate and contribute to this programme.</li>
