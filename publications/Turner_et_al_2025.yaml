title: "TRAPUM search for pulsars in supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae − II. Survey analysis and population study"
author: "Turner et al."
year: 2025
psrrefs: "Turner+2025"
blurb: "We present the final results of the TRAPUM search for pulsars associated with supernova remnants (SNRs), pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and unidentified TeV emission. We conduct a population-based analysis to explain the results and infer properties of the young pulsar population connected to SNRs."
